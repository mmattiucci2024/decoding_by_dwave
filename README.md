The file decode.py is a simple python program (example) to decode a matrix Q (dictionary) using DWAVE Quantum Annealer, solving the related QUBO problem. 
Q was constructed by encoding a binary sequence [1, 0, 0, 1] into only the following variables: [x0, x1, x3, x5] (see the code for more information).
